  **"Decoding Earth's surface dynamics through automated multi-spectral classification to drive sustainable land-use governance."**

  **Project Overview:**  
  A comprehensive framework for generating high-resolution thematic maps by integrating cloud-based remote sensing with supervised machine learning. This project focuses on converting raw pixel data into classified land-use layers to monitor urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural patterns.

  **Technical Workflow:**
  *   **Feature Engineering:** Integrating multi-temporal **Sentinel-2** and **Landsat** imagery with spectral indices (**NDVI, NDBI, NDWI**) and topographic data (SRTM) to improve class separability.
  *   **ML Implementation:** Deploying and comparing **Random Forest (RF)** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifiers to achieve optimal pixel-based and object-oriented classification.
  *   **Rigorous Validation:** Automated generation of **Confusion Matrices** to calculate Overall Accuracy, User's/Producer's accuracy, and Kappa Coefficients for scientific reliability.
  *   **Change Detection:** Post-classification comparison (PCC) to quantify land-use transitions and identify rapid "built-up" expansion hotspots.
  
  **Planning Application:**  
  Supports **Master Plan Development** and **Environmental Conservation** by providing precise baselines for green-space ratios, urban growth boundaries, and land-encroachment monitoring.
